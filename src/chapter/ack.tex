    \noindent I am thankful to my parents, \textbf{Rodica} and \textbf{Dorin}, whose 
    sacrifices have been the starting point of my success. The hard work and faith they have demonstrated, alongside the decision to emigrate from Romania to Italy for the sake of providing me with a brighter future, have been the driving force of my aspirations. Their love and support have been my constant source of strength.

    \noindent Last but not least, I would like to express my appreciation to my two cats, \textbf{Mimmi} and \textbf{Shelby}. Their companionship during the long nights of study has been a relief. They have been silent and sleepy witnesses to my struggles and accomplishments, their presence is a constant reminder of the importance of the little things in life.
