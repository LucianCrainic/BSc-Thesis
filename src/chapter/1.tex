   \section{Problem statement}

      Traditionally, movement classification requires high-quality sensors and complicated computer vision algorithms. However, with the arrival of the Microsoft Kinect sensor and the release of the Kinect SDK \cite{jana_kinect_2012}, it is now possible to obtain high-quality 3D skeleton data with a relatively low-cost device and with minimal effort. This opens up the possibility of using this data to classify movements performed by individuals, which can be used in a variety of applications, such as rehabilitation, sports, and fall risk assessment. In this thesis, the focus is on the latter, with the goal of using Kinect skeleton data to classify movements performed by elderly individuals.
  
   \section{Literature review}

      In recent times, detection and classification of human activity have found a wide range of applications in various fields. Among various sensors used, the Kinect sensor stands out for its affordability and ease of use. S.A. Abdul Shukor and Nor Asilah Saidin. conducted a study utilizing a Kinect sensor to detect human falls. Their system demonstrated accurate results \cite{saidin_analysis_2020}. 
      Tao Wang et al. conducted a study that involved gait analysis using a Kinect sensor for automatic and real-time detection of depression. The model developed achieved a classification accuracy of 93.75\% \cite{wang_gait_2021}.
      Naveen Kumar Mangal and Anil Kumar Tiwari conducted a study that developed a filter to improve the quality of three-dimensional coordinate data surrounding the body. With the aim of generating a movement signature crucial for kinematic analysis of musculoskeletal disorders. Findings from the study revealed that the range of motion values derived from the proposed filter significantly improved the monitoring accuracy of skeletal joints using a Kinect sensor \cite{mangal_kinect_2020}. 
      Shalini Nehra and Jagdish Lal Raheja created a human activity recognition system designed for indoor monitoring and detection of daily activities using a Kinect sensor. The results demonstrated the system's consistently high accuracy across various datasets, as reported in \cite{nehra_unobtrusive_2020}.
      Tan-Hsu Tan et al. conducted a study that developed a detection system to identify both daily and abnormal activities in elderly individuals. The performance was evaluated using a fourfold cross-validation approach, with precision at 95.5\%, recall at 95.6\%, specificity at 99.8\%, accuracy at 99.6\%, and an F1 score of 95.3\% \cite{tan_activity_2020}. 
      Weiyan Ren et al. used a Kinect sensor to gather posture data from twenty individuals while lying in bed. Data was then subjected to a Machine Learning approach using support vector Machines architecture, resulting in a classification success rate of 97.1\% \cite{ren_human_2020}.
      \"{O}mer Faruk \.{I}nce et al. introduced an innovative biometric system designed to identify human activities within three-dimensional space. The study used the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm as part of a Machine Learning approach for classification, achieving an accuracy of 86.1\% \cite{ince_human_2020}.
      Pramod Kumar Pisharady and Martin Saerbeck presented a multi-class algorithm for human posture detection and recognition. This algorithm remained invariant to changes in position and scale by leveraging geometric properties from Kinect data. Tested in both offline and real-time applications, it achieved a classification success of 95.78\% \cite{pisharady_kinect_2013}.
      Tao Wang et al. introduced a method for accurately distinguishing between various postures of five different individuals. A classification success rate exceeding 99\% was achieved \cite{wang_gait_2021}.


      \vspace{0.5cm}
      
      After reviewing the literature, a consistent trend was observed: the effectiveness of motion classification tends to reduce as the number of classes increases. Therefore, there is a recognized need for further research to improve classification performance in multi-class scenarios \cite{acis_classification_2023}. This study is specially focused on improving classification accuracy across 10 distinct classes.

   \section{Dataset overview}
      
      In this thesis, a dataset of Kinect skeleton data is used. Composed of recorded movements performed by a group of 22 individuals in front of a Kinect sensor, data is saved as a series of 3D coordinates. It contains 10 different movements, each performed a various number of times by each individual. The movements are listed in Table \ref{tab:movement_table}.
