   \section{Dataset Overview}
   % In this study, we utilized a Kinect Skeleton dataset, provided by the PsyComp Lab.,which plays a crucial role in the development of this research. This dataset is composed of recorded movements performed by a group of 22 individuals. The movements were performed in front of a Kinect sensor, which recorded the movements and saved them as a series of 3D coordinates. The dataset contains 10 different movements, each performed a various number of times by each individual. The movements are as follows:
