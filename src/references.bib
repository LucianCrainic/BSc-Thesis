	abstract = {We have seen six patients, over the past two years, who had developed intense fear of standing or walking as a result of accidental falls. None of these patients showed any evidence of neuromuscular impairment that might account for their inability to walk. However, the results of psychological evaluations of all these patients revealed high degrees of focal anxiety that was phobic in nature and related to standing or walking. Personality assessments of these patients showed little or no evidence of psychopathology of a generalized nature or of personality trait disturbance. The phobic reaction was the primary psychological disturbance underlying their fear to stand or walk. Each patient demonstrated evidence of both reduction of anxiety and functional improvement in walking following behavioral desensitization and physical therapy. We believe this disorder is a distinct psychological problem unrelated to agoraphobia, and we propose using the term "ptophobia" when describing this clinical entity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fear of falling (FOF) is prevalent among older adults and associated with adverse health outcomes. Over recent years a substantial body of research has emerged on its epidemiology, associated factors, and consequences. This scoping review summarizes the FOF literature published between April 2015 and March 2020 in order to inform current practice and identify gaps in the literature.
	METHODS: A total of 439 articles related to FOF in older adults were identified, 56 selected for full-text review, and 46 retained for data extraction and synthesis.
	RESULTS: The majority of included studies were cross-sectional. Older age, female sex, previous falls, worse physical performance, and depressive symptoms were the factors most consistently associated with FOF. Studies that measured FOF with a single question reported a significantly lower prevalence of FOF than those using the Falls Efficacy Scale, a continuous measure. FOF was associated with higher likelihoods of future falls, short-term mortality, and functional decline.
	CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons between studies were limited by inconsistent definition and measurement of FOF, falls, and other characteristics. Consensus on how to measure FOF and which participant characteristics to evaluate would address this issue. Gaps in the literature include clarifying the relationships between FOF and cognitive, psychological, social, and environmental factors.},
