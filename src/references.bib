	abstract = {In DetailKinect has been a game-changer in the world of motion games and applications since its first release. It has been touted as a controller for Microsoft Xbox but is much more than that. The developer version of Kinect, Kinect for Windows SDK, provides developers with the tools to develop applications that run on Windows. You can use this to develop applications that make interaction with your computer hands-free. 

  This book focuses on developing applications using the Kinect for Windows SDK. It is a complete end to end solution using different features of Kinect for Windows SDK with step by step guidance. The book will also help you develop motion sensitive and speech recognition enabled applications. You will also learn about building application using multiple Kinects.

  The book begins with explaining the different components of Kinect and then moves into to the setting up the device and getting thedevelopment environment ready. You will be surprised at how quickly the book takes you through the details of Kinect APIs. You will use NUI to use the Kinect for Natural Inputs like skeleton tracking, sensing, speech recognizing. 

  You will capture different types of stream, and images, handle stream event, and capture frame. Kinect device contains a motorized tilt to control sensor angles, you will learn how to adjust it automatically. The last part of the book teaches you how to build application using multiple Kinects and discuss how Kinect can be used to integrate with other devices such as Windows Phone and microcontroller.

  ApproachThis book is a practical tutorial that explains different features of Kinect for Windows SDK by creating sample applications throughout the book

  Who this book is forThe purpose of this book is to explain how to develop applications using the Kinect for Windows SDK. If you are a beginner and looking to start developing applications using the Kinect for Windows SDK, and if you want to build motion-sensing,speech-recognizing applications with Kinect, this book is for you.

  This book uses C\# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) in the examples, so you need to know the basics of C\# and WPF. You should be familiar with the Visual Studio IDE as well. You don't have to know anything about the Kinect for Windows SDK.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fear of falling (FOF) is prevalent among older adults and associated with adverse health outcomes. Over recent years a substantial body of research has emerged on its epidemiology, associated factors, and consequences. This scoping review summarizes the FOF literature published between April 2015 and March 2020 in order to inform current practice and identify gaps in the literature.
  METHODS: A total of 439 articles related to FOF in older adults were identified, 56 selected for full-text review, and 46 retained for data extraction and synthesis.
  RESULTS: The majority of included studies were cross-sectional. Older age, female sex, previous falls, worse physical performance, and depressive symptoms were the factors most consistently associated with FOF. Studies that measured FOF with a single question reported a significantly lower prevalence of FOF than those using the Falls Efficacy Scale, a continuous measure. FOF was associated with higher likelihoods of future falls, short-term mortality, and functional decline.
  CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons between studies were limited by inconsistent definition and measurement of FOF, falls, and other characteristics. Consensus on how to measure FOF and which participant characteristics to evaluate would address this issue. Gaps in the literature include clarifying the relationships between FOF and cognitive, psychological, social, and environmental factors.},

However, it is currently under used. Developments in depth cameras, such as Kinect, have opened up the use of motion analysis in settings such as GP surgeries, care homes and private homes. To provide an insight into the use of Kinect in the healthcare domain, we present a review of the current state of the art. We then propose a method that can represent human motions from time-series data of arbitrary length, as a single vector. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this method by extracting a set of clinically significant features and using them to detect the age related changes in the motions of a set of 54 individuals, with a high degree of certainty (F1-score between 0.9-1.0). Indicating its potential application in the detection of a range of age-related motion impairments.},

Traditionally, poses recognition requires high quality expensive cameras and complicated computer vision algorithms. This is not the case thanks to the Microsoft Kinect sensor which provides an inexpensive and easy way for real time user interaction. In this paper, we proposed a real time human poses classification technique, by using skeleton data provided by the Kinect sensor. Different users performed a set of tasks from a vocabulary of eighteen poses. From skeleton data of each pose, twenty features are extracted so that they are invariant with respect to the user's size and its position in the scene. We then compared the generalization performances of four machine learning algorithms, support vectors machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Bayes classifier (BC). The method used in this work shows that SVM outperforms the other algorithms.},

XGBoost is a scalable ensemble technique that has demonstrated to be a reliable and efficient machine learning challenge solver. LightGBM is an accurate model focused on providing extremely fast training performance using selective sampling of high gradient instances. CatBoost modifies the computation of gradients to avoid the prediction shift in order to improve the accuracy of the model. This work proposes a practical analysis of how these novel variants of gradient boosting work in terms of training speed, generalization performance and hyper-parameter setup. In addition, a comprehensive comparison between XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, random forests and gradient boosting has been performed using carefully tuned models as well as using their default settings. The results of this comparison indicate that CatBoost obtains the best results in generalization accuracy and AUC in the studied datasets although the differences are small. LightGBM is the fastest of all methods but not the most accurate. Finally, XGBoost places second both in accuracy and in training speed. Finally an extensive analysis of the effect of hyper-parameter tuning in XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost is carried out using two novel proposed tools.},

Recently, numerous researchers have actively utilized artiﬁcial intelligence technology to establish accurate waste generation information. This study investigated the development of machine learning predictive models that can achieve predictive performance on small datasets composed of categorical variables. To this end, the random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithms were adopted. To develop the models, 690 building datasets were established using data preprocessing and standardization. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to develop the RF and GBM models. The model performances were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. The study demonstrated that, for small datasets comprising mainly categorical variables, the bagging technique (RF) predictions were more stable and accurate than those of the boosting technique (GBM). However, GBM models demonstrated excellent predictive performance in some DW predictive models. Furthermore, the RF and GBM predictive models demonstrated signiﬁcantly differing performance across different types of DW. Certain RF and GBM models demonstrated relatively low predictive performance. However, the remaining predictive models all demonstrated excellent predictive performance at R2 values {\textgreater} 0.6, and R values {\textgreater} 0.8. Such differences are mainly because of the characteristics of features applied to model development; we expect the application of additional features to improve the performance of the predictive models. The 11 DW predictive models developed in this study will be useful for establishing detailed DW management strategies.},

The classifier consists of multiple trees constructed systematically by pseudorandomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector, that is, trees constructed in randomly chosen subspaces. The subspace method is compared to single-tree classifiers and other forest construction methods by experiments on publicly available datasets, where the method's superiority is demonstrated.

Fischer in 1936. It consists in finding the projection hyperplane that minimizes the interclass variance and maximizes the distance between the projected means of the classes. Similarly to PCA, these two objectives can be solved by solving an eigenvalue problem with the corresponding eigenvector defining the hyperplane of interest. This hyperplane can be used for classification, dimensionality reduction and for interpretation of the importance of the given features. In the first part of the chapter we discuss the generic formulation of LDA whereas in the second we present the robust counterpart scheme originally proposed by Kim and Boyd.
