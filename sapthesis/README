** Class information ************************************************

      Sapthesis is a LaTeX class to typeset theses that adhere to 
	  "Sapienza - University of Rome"'s guidelines for publishing.
	  
      It is compatible with two compilation methods:
      pdflatex and xelatex.

      The documentation is provided in the file sapthesis-doc.pdf.
      
      The version number of this class is reported at the top of the
      class file sapthesis.cls and in the pdf manual
      sapthesis-doc.pdf.



** Installation instruction *****************************************

      Sapthesis can be installed in 3 different ways:
	  
	  1. The simplest way to install sapthesis is by the package manager
      of your TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX or MacTeX).
      
      2. Instead, if you want to install sapthesis manually, you have to
      download the sapthesis.zip archive from CTAN or from
      the official sapthesis website
      http://biccari.altervista.org/c/informatica/latex/sapthesis.php
      
      The sapthesis.zip archive contains: 

        1. sapthesis.cls (main file)
        2. sapthesis-doc.pdf (manual of sapthesis.cls)
        3. sapthesis-doc.tex (source of the manual)
        4. README (this file)
        5. sapienzalogo.pdf (university logo)
        6. sapthesis.bst (an english BibTeX style)
		7. sapthesis.layout (sapthesis layout file for LyX)

	  You can simply copy sapthesis.cls and sapthesis.bst
      together with sapienzalogo.pdf into your local
	  work directory where your thesis files will live.
	  
      3. The last possibility is copying the files of Sapthesis
	  (discussed in the previous point) into your texmf tree
      (or your localtexmf tree) at these locations:

      <texmf>/tex/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis.cls
      <texmf>/tex/latex/sapthesis/sapienzalogo.pdf
      <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis-doc.pdf
      <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis-doc.tex
      <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/README
      <texmf>/bibtex/bst/sapthesis/sapthesis.bst
	  <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis.layout

      Then, you need to update the file database.
