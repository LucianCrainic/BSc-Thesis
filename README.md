# Machine Learning for Human Movement Classification Based on Kinect Skeleton Data

## Abstract
This thesis conducts a detailed comparative study of several Machine Learning models, focusing on their application to Kinect skeleton data for classifying human movements. The research evaluates models such as Support-Vector Machines, Random Forests, Linear Regression, among others, for their accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in this task. Using a dataset of movements captured through a Microsoft Kinect, the study employs pre-processing, feature extraction, and model evaluation to assess performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, offering insights for researchers and professionals in the field. The results set a foundation for developing more accurate and efficient systems for human movement classification.
